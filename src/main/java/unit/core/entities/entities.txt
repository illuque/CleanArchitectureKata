Entities are the heart of clean architecture and contain any enterprise-wide business rules and logic.

Now, you might not be working in the context of an enterprise. If you're writing a standalone application Uncle Bob
suggests simply referring to these as Business Objects.

The key is that they contain rules that are not application specific - so basically any global or shareable logic that
could be reused in other applications should be encapsulated in an entity. Also any logic that you consider almost
static in your domain should go here.
