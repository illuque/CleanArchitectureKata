These services are typically referred to as Gateways within clean architecture and get injected into the Use Case layer
as per the dependency rule (IoC). These are the things that deal with the database, rest services or other external
agencies and their implementation belongs in the Interface Adapters layer. Interactors only know what behavior these
gateways offer by way of their interface definition. They have no idea how they do their work because those details are
encapsulated in an outer layer which the Use Cases know nothing about.
