The purpose of the Interface Adapter Layer is to act as a connector between the business logic in our Interactors
(UseCases) and our framework-specific code. For example, in an ASP.Net MVC app, this is where the models, views, and
controllers live.

Gateway-like services and repositories to access database are also implemented here.
