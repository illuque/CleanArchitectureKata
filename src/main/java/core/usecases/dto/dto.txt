DTO = Data Transfer Objects

One key aspect of the DTO's that flow in and out of use case Interactors (UseCases) and across boundaries is that they
are simple data structures meaning they contain no special types: ie. entities, or types provided by 3rd party libs etc.
They are pure <C#, java, javascript> objects.
